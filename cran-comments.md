## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.3

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. There is one NOTE:  
  Maintainer: Joshua Schwab <joshuaschwab@yahoo.com>
  (this is my correct email)
  
  
This NOTE has been fixed, sorry about that:
* checking top-level files ... NOTE
Non-standard file/directory found at top level:
  'revdep'


## Downstream dependencies
I have run devtools::revdep_check on ltmle. There is 1 downstream dependency and no failures were reported.
